        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
          I am programmer and student of NAMI first year; which is located in
          Jorpati, Kathmandu. I have been learning to code since I was 14.
          I fell in love with coding when I write programme that shows hello world!.<br><br>

          I was born in 12th December, 1998 in the eastern part of Nepal. Which is not
          develoved as compared to the the Central Development region, So there is less
          chance of being nerd with technology, due to the lack of capital and education.
          It was a big deal to make our way to school. I completed my schooling level from
		  Narayani Higher Secondary School in 2013. After completing the school level I
		  came to Kathmandu for my higher studies. At that time I was so much confused that
		  which subject Should I choose. But, I made my choice clear and went with science.
		  I completed my high school from Universal College in 2015. I had a lot of oppertunity to
		  learn new things about computer during my high school. And after high school I made my choice
		  of becoming software engineer. And I am here at NAMI first semester.
		  <br><br>

          As my main intrest is in coding, I learned several programming languages.
          I am fully experienced with Java and PHP; and I have made several websites for
          personal use and official use.
